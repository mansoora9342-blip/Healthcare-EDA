# Healthcare Patient Analytics | Python | JSON


# Project Description

 An end-to-end data analysis project on healthcare patient records stored in JSON format. The goal is to clean messy real-world data, perform EDA,and extract meaningful healthcare insights.

# Dataset Overview

2,000+ patient records
Format: JSON
Columns:
patient_id, age, gender, disease,
department, visit_count, billing_amount
Data Issues: 
Missing values
Duplicate patient IDs
Incomplete and inconsistent entries

# Tools & Libraries Used

Python
Pandas
NumPy
Matplotlib
Seaborn
Google Colab 


# Data Processing Steps

1. Load raw JSON data into Pandas DataFrame
2. Inspect structure and data types
3. Handle missing values and duplicates
4. Clean and standardize columns
5. Prepare data for analysis


# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Disease distribution analysis
- Age group and gender analysis
- Department-wise patient visits
- Billing amount trends
- High-risk demographic identification


# Key Findings

- Diabetes, Hypertension, and Heart Disease
  are the most common conditions
- Elderly patients show higher visit counts
  and billing amounts
- Emergency and Cardiology departments
  handle the majority of critical cases
- Data cleaning is essential for reliable
  healthcare insights


# Conclusion

This project highlights practical experience
in healthcare data cleaning, EDA, and visualization using Python. It reflects real-world healthcare analytics challenges and supports data-driven decision making.
